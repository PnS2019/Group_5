Project Schedule:

1-3. Week: 
read the Mnist Dataset from: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ into Python. ( or different dataset)
Train the Model with linear regression. Perhaps with a deep convolutional neural network
The Model should be able to distinguish:
- numbers "1 - 9"
- Basic operations: "*,/ ,+ , -"
- The equal sign: "="


3-4. Week: 
Refine the model with different learning algorithms.
Try to read first numbers and signs from images captured with the Rasberry Pi camera.( As seen in session 5)
Implement a simple calculator.
Do first simple calculations. For example 5 + 1 = ...

4-5. Week:
Speech output. Read the equation and also give the output. ( With text-to-speech implementation from Yuhuang)
Prepare the presentation and many examples.


If we have enough time we try to implement more operations and more complex computations.
