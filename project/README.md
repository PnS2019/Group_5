# Calculator on Rasberry Pi using PiCam & handwritten tasks

This is a project being done in the "Deep Learning on Raberry Pi" class, offered by ETH Zurich and UZH. It's a calculator, installed on Rasberry Pi and using state of the art Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques to recognize handwritten calculations, computing them and finally output the result through a built-in speaker.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
numpy
tensorflow
pnslib
etc
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
change the datapaths in main.py fitting to the machine you're operating on

Use terminal go to the location of the main.py file
```
cd "to the main.py file"
python3 main.py
```
